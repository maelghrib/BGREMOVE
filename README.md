# BGREMOVE
Image background removal that gives you high-quality images using the best ML models

## HOW IT WORKS?
- You upload an image, and the code uses an upscale model that increases the resolution of the image to give a high-quality image
- Then it uses the upscaled image to remove the background using 8 of the best ML models
- It will give the results and you can browse the images and choose the image you like and download
